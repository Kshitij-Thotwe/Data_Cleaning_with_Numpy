# Data Cleaning with Numpy

This project involves cleaning of Loan Data that we get in Dollars which is an American Standard to Euro which is the European Standard. Cleaning and preprocessing is done with the help of python library of NumPy which is widely used for numerical computations

## Technologies:

Python (Data analysis) : NumPy (Numerical computing)

## Dataset:

The two datasets required are uploaded within the repository named as loan-data.csv and EUR-USD.csv

## Task List:

Import libraries and load data
Clean and preprocess data
